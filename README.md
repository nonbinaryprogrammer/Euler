## About This Project
Project Euler problems are intended to be solved independently. Please do not
use these solutions when doing the problems for yourself.
I have solved these problems in C.

## Dependencies
Many of the questions depend on my math library for my BigInt class, which you
can find [here](http://github.com/bales2/MathLib).

## How to use
For any problem that does not include my mathlib, you can use <code>gcc
problem<#>.c</code> to compile and <code>./a.out</code> to run. If the math
library is included, you must use <code>g++ problem<#>.c</code> to compile the
program, since the class is written in C++.
